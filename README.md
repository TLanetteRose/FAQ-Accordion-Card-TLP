# FAQ-Accordion-Card-TLP (HTML & CSS)
Frontend Mentor Challenge

![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The Challenge
Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## Background
This challenge tested my comfort level with positioning in CSS. My goal was to complete the challenge using only HTML and CSS. First I learned about using the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements to build the accordion. I realized that it wasn't flexible enough for me and didn't truly help me understand how to build an accordion. 

Then I found a tutorial that used `<input>` and `<label>` for the accordion features. When I used this method, I was able to understand the basics for designing an accordion. 

I also used a global CSS Reset so that my page would be uniform across multiple browsers. I used the  [Condensed Universal Reset](https://perishablepress.com/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles/). I am still researching about the best resets to use. However, this one served my needs for this page. 
### Other Topics I Learned
- Positioning my images and elements was still a work in progress for me. I thought I had a strong understanding of moving an element **right**, **left**, **top**, and **bottom**. Everytime I scrolled on the page, my images would not stay positioned within the paretn element. After some research and experimentation, I gained a better understanding of when to apply `right: 0px` or `left: 0px`. 
- I learned more about using  pseudocodes `::before` and `::after`. In my first accordion CSS code, I used `::before` to place background color on top of section. In my final CSS, I only used the `::after` pseudocode to place the arrow icon images on my accordion panels.
