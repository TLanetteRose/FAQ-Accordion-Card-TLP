# FAQ-Accordion-Card-TLP (HTML & CSS)
Frontend Mentor Challenge

![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The Challenge
Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## Background
This challenge tested my comfort level with positioning in CSS. My goal was to complete the challenge using only HTML and CSS. First I learned about using the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements to build the accordion. Realized that it wasn't flexible enough for me and didn't truly help me understand how to build an accordion. 

Then I found a tutorial that used `<input>` and `<label>` for the accordion

Positioning is still a work in progress. I learned that setting  one position to 0 will keep it from moving when you resize the page. I get  it now. right: 0;
